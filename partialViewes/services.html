            <strong>Modas International</strong> telemetry system can be used to transfer data captured remotely. Any analogue signal, usually from a transducer, or digital signal can be projected to the hardware. Also, digital information can be transferred through Modbus and digital telemetry system (GPRS) to the Web Interface. Product Capabilities
            <ul>
              <li>
                The telemetry system is able to work as a traditional Stand Alone unit providing SMS Alerts, Automated SMS Reports and Triggered SMS Reports.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a powerful Internet Infrastructure (GPRS) with a Web Application to display remote information. The Web Application is the front end of the telemetry system. All the information sent by the remote devices is displayed on the portal. A number of tools, configuration options, graphing, virtual instrumentation and more are available. The unique Customer Based Management System provides the ability to manage simultaneously multiple number of customers and installations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fleet Management
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remote monitoring has become an essential part in everyday life. The ability to monitor, control and manage remote devices is an important factor for companies that can’t afford equipment failure. Remote information is transmitted via the HTTP POST protocol to a HTTP server or via TCP/UDP to a server. The data are collected in a database and the measurements of each individual station are displayed through the portal. Data is sent at a pre-defined transmission interval via the User Interface at initial installation or from the web application remotely. If SMS alerts have been configured, a registered engineer will receive an SMS/e-mail if a threshold/criteria is monitored.</p>
            <h5>MedicaTrack GPS</h5>
            <p>Fleet management is an essential tool in a company that has a fleet of vehicles covering a vast region. Knowing the position and the status of a vehicle, helps a company plan and manage its fleet in a more effective way.</p>
            <h5>SMS & E-mail Alerts</h5>
            <p>An SMS, E-mail or both could be issued when a predefined input level is met. A feature we have included is the assignment of engineers per device. Therefore, every individual engineer is alerted by an assigned remote device</p>
